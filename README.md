# IP-HOST AUTO-HEADER | Browser extension
## Supported browsers: Chrome, Chromium

Current version: **1.0** | 2022-02-24

**The IP-HOST AUTO-HEADER extension allows you to create a list of IP addresses and their corresponding hosts.
Hostnames assigned to the IP address are then automatically appended to the request in the HTTP "Host" header if a connection to the given IP address is detected. This enables automated access to servers using their IP addresses and a prepared list against domain names. The list of IP addresses / hosts can be exported / imported from a JSON file.**
