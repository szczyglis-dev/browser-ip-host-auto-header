# IP-HOST AUTO-HEADER | Browser extension
## Supported browsers: Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Chromium

Current version: **1.2** | 2022-02-28

**The IP-HOST AUTO-HEADER extension allows you to create a list of IP addresses and their corresponding hosts.
Hostnames assigned to the IP address are then automatically appended to the request in the HTTP "Host" header if a connection to the given IP address is detected. This enables automated access to servers using their IP addresses and a prepared list against domain names. The list of IP addresses / hosts can be exported / imported from a JSON file.**

## Features:

- easy to use
- provides access to websites via an IP address
- provides access to websites during DNS failure
- allows you to create your own list of IP addresses and their assigned hosts
- automatically detects if the requested IP address is on the list
- automatically includes the appropriate HTTP Host header to the request
- allows you to import / export a list of IP addresses and hosts
